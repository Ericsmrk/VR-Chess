Note: after you make the gh folder shortcut all changes within that folder will show on the github desktop application.

USE GITHUB DESKTOP 
download github desktop
log into your github in gh desktop
clone your fork from the list of your repos
click view in explorer
make a shortcut of the gh folder and put on your desktop (this makes for easy access)
then click open in vs code

NOTE: DID NOT USE OUTDATED BOILERPLATE

(Note: These instructions are outdated. Need to be updated for node.js. 
tldr: install node.js, npm install, npm start)

HOST LOCALLY (can use this as a default if you don't want to use gh pages)
(install python)
open a terminal inside of the project folder you made
run : python -m http.server
go to http://localhost:8000 to see project
